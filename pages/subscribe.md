If you'd like to receive updates from {{ site.title }}, please subscribe to the provided RSS feed via the button below.

<div id="rss-button"><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fas fa-rss-square fa-6x"></i></a></div>


With RSS, you don't have to worry about emails, and all you have to do to unsubscribe is delete the feed from your reader. Free RSS readers are available everywhere. My personal favorite is a free Chrome Extension, [FeedBro](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} . When a new post is published, a little badge will appear in your extension toolbar. Check it out!
