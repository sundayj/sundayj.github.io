    The NPM Script Selector is a CLI tool for discovering and running project scripts within package.json files.
    Have you ever worked on a project that contains so many scripts that you can't always remember the available options? That's what happened to me.
    I currently contribute to a project with 30+ scripts. I became tired of having to open the package file and/or
    IDE in order to find and run the needed the scripts, so I created this small CLI. Currently, you provide the path
    to the package.json file, the NPM Script Selector will then list the available scripts for you, where you can
    interactively select the one you want. It will then run the script for you within the selected project's directory.
    I plan to add more functionality in the near future. Uses figlet, commander, and inquirer.
