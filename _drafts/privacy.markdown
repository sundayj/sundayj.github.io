Wondering how Ghost fares when it comes to privacy and GDPR rules? Good news: Ghost does not use any tracking cookies of any kind.

You can integrate any products, services, ads or integrations with Ghost yourself if you want to, but it's always a good idea to disclose how subscriber data will be used by putting together a privacy page.
