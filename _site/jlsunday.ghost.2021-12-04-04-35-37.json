Don't let its minimal looks fool\nyou, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to\naccommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.\n\nFor many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start\nwriting as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would\nexpect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.\n\nOur main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things\nthat you hope/expect might work: actually work. \n\n * You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best\n   to correctly preserve the formatting. \n * Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.\n * Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.\n * Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top:\n   Ghost will turn it into a link.\n * You can also paste (or write!) Markdown and Ghost will usually be able to\n   auto-convert it into fully editable, formatted content.\n\nThe Ghost editor. Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.\nThe goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don't have to \nthink so much about the editor. You won't find any disastrous \"block builders\"\nhere, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but\nidentical alignment options. That's not what Ghost is about.\n\nWhat you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media\ninto your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.\n\nUsing cards\nYou can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the + button, which\nappears on new lines, or by typing / on a new line to trigger the card menu.\nMany of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow\nyou to create rich links with embedded structured data:\n\nOpen Subscription PlatformsA shared movement for independent subscription data.\nOpen Subscription Platforms [https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/]or embed\ncards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience,\nfrom external services:\n\nBut, dig a little deeper, and you'll also find more advanced cards, like one\nthat only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions)\nand a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and\ngalleries.\n\n> Once you  start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of\nthe story changes.

Give your\nsnippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from\nwithin the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the / command.\n\nThis works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a\ncompany logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking\nto, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.\n\nYou can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick,\nre-usable workflow for publishing over time.

While I have found some \nGREAT resources out there, let’s just say I’ve wasted a lot of time on \nnot-so-great resources others. So, what I’m hoping to do here is share tutorials\nand resources that will hopefully prevent you from wasting your time as well.\nWhile there are many tutorials out there, most of them don’t go into enough\ndetail or only cover the most basic use cases.
