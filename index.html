                <p>n the Midlands TechHire program, this project was a final culmination of everything we had learned throughout the front-end development program. Started and completed from scratch, we followed directions out of small book to complete a "five page" website for Adventures Insurance. Due to the length of the directions in the book, I will not include of them in this repository, but I will try to describe the main objectives in this "README" file. We were given three days to complete this project. I received the grade of "A." More information <a href="https://github.com/sundayj/Website_Production_Lab/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.</p>
