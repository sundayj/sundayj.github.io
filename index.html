                <p>The Musical Ladder system hired Severien to clean up and completely redesign their web application. I was charged with the task of designing, building, and implementing a brand new front-end user experience for both the mobile and desktop versions of the app. As I was designing, I had to keep code modularity in mind, as the app would be finalized using the Laravel PHP framework.

Started and completed from scratch, we followed directions out of small book to complete a "five page" website for Adventures Insurance.
